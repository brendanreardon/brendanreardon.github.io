## Welcome!

My name is Brendan Reardon and I am currently a computational biologist in the [Van Allen laboratory](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/) at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/) and the [Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), using clinical computational oncology for precision cancer medicine. 

Previously, I studied physics at [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/) and was an undergraduate researcher with the [Radio Astronomy Group](https://www.brandeis.edu/physics/research/radio-astronomy.html) and I spent a summer at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/) in Ireland with the [Radio Astronomy and Active Galactic Nuclei](https://www.ucc.ie/en/raagn/) group. 

You can follow me on [Github](https://github.com/brendanreardon), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendan_reardon), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendan-reardon-ba3b7247/) and find links to published research on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K_J6gxsAAAAJ&hl=en).
