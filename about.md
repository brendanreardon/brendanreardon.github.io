My name is Brendan Reardon and I am currently a computational biologist in the [Van Allen laboratory](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, using clinical computational oncology for precision cancer medicine. Here, I lead the [clinical interpretation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-021-00243-3){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} group, manage our cloud compute and storage infastructure, and contribute to various other research projects. Additionally, I am a graduate student in the [Culhane Lab](https://www.ul.ie/research/prof-aedin-culhane){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} at the University of Limerick. 

# Previously
I studied physics and creative writing at [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I was an undergraduate researcher with the [Radio Astronomy Group](https://www.brandeis.edu/physics/research/radio-astronomy.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and I spent a summer at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} in Ireland with the [Radio Astronomy and Active Galactic Nuclei](https://www.ucc.ie/en/raagn/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} group. In addition, I worked at the [Technology Help Desk](https://www.brandeis.edu/its/support/helpdesk/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} as a student manager and technician.
