My name is Brendan Reardon and I am currently a computational biologist in the [Van Allen laboratory](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/){:target="_blank"} at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/){:target="_blank"}, using clinical computational oncology for precision cancer medicine. Here, I lead the [clinicogenomics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-021-00243-3){:target="_blank"} working group, manage our cloud compute and storage infrastructure, and contribute to [various other research projects](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K_J6gxsAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}. Additionally, I am a graduate student in the [Culhane lab](https://www.ul.ie/ehs/medicine/prof-aedin-culhane){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Limerick](https://www.ul.ie/){:target="_blank"}. 

# Previously
I studied physics and creative writing at [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I was an undergraduate researcher with the [Radio Astronomy Group](https://www.brandeis.edu/physics/research/radio-astronomy.html){:target="_blank"} and worked at the Technology Help Desk as a student manager and technician. While there I received the Provost's Undergraduate Research Fund to spend a summer at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/){:target="_blank"} with the [Radio Astronomy and Active Galactic Nuclei](https://www.ucc.ie/en/raagn/){:target="_blank"} group.
